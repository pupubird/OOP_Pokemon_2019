----------

1. When a Pokemon attacks, they gain 2 EXP instead of 1. In this example, the attacker also loses 3 energy instead of 2.

2. When a Pokemon attacks with insufficient energy, they continue to lose energy and gain experience. They also carry out coin flip events, which are unnecessary.

3. Poisoned / paralyzed Pokemon can still attack. [SOLVED]

4. An attacking Pokemon always loses 2 energy instead of only when weakness is valid.

5. The AI tries to train a Pokemon with insufficient energy, which skips their turn.

6. Poison / paralysis status does not count down.
