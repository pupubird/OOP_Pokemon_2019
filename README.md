## Pokémon as a game

The following program is inspired by the popular trading card game (TCG) Pokémon. This program takes inspiration from the game but is not meant to be a recreation of it in any way, shape or form. For this program, the JavaFX module is used to design the UI, while most of the logic of the game is written in Java.

The famous Pokémon TCG is known for being a simple card game with infinite strategies to apply. With that said, two players face off in a battle of cards; each player takes turn playing cards and setting up the game board to fight the opponent, usually winning if they are able to defeat all of the opposing player's Pokémon.

In this variant of the game, the rules are slightly changed: victory is achieved once a player is able to defeat 3 out of the opponent's 6 Pokémon. Additional actions, as well as new features have been added to the game for a twist.

Some of the key features of this game are as follows:

1. Simplified GUI
Unlike most versions of the Pokémon TCG, which are likely using Command Line Interface (CLI) to receive and process user input, the usage of JavaFX in this program allows for the introduction of JavaFX elements such as buttons and viewports to create a more visually appealing presentation.

2. Bright and colorful visuals
The program is able to present vivid scenes with colorful sprites for the Pokémon that you will fight. With plenty of animations and SFX, it all comes together to create an immersive experience.

3. Presentation of detail
Although the Pokémon game has many details that may or may not be relevant to the player, this version of the game neatly presents attributes such as HP and Attack Power as well as actions such as Attacking and Training altogether, without taking up too much space on the screen. This not only keeps the player informed of the current game situation, but also allows them to evaluate their choices in between turns.

With said features, the player is able to focus on enjoying the game and doesn't suffer from many inconveniences. This play contributes towards our program's strengths:

1. User-friendly interface
Said usage of the JavaFX framework in designing the interface reduces the difficulty of user interaction, with the help of buttons and images which are easy for players to interact with.

2. Visually appealing
With the addition of colorful sprites and plenty of sounds to simulate the experience, players are able to focus on the game without getting distracted by other elements of the program which may draw their attention.

3. Convenient and well-planned
Being able to save game states allows players to pause and resume games in the case of times where playing is inappropriate for the current environment. This makes the game more accessible as it can be played at any time.

In conclusion, these features and the benefits they bring allow for an excellent game which provides enhanced user experience in terms of the interface as well as gameplay.
